Creating an EVM Subnet using Avalanche CLI

## Description

In this project I have made my own EVM Subnet using Avalanche CLI. This project aims to leverage the Avalanche platform's capabilities to create a secure and scalable environment to decentralized applications, with a focus on Ethereum compability. The subnet configuration ensures seamless interoperability with existing Ethereum tooling and smart contracts, providing a foundation for the development of decentralized application. I have named my native token as "KRSNA"

## Getting Started

### Installing

* Firstly, install the Avalanche CLI on your devices.
* Make sure to install "go language".

### Executing program

* Check if the Avalanche CLI has been installed correctly.
* Create a subnet and deploy the subnet.
* Now, interact with the contract using remix.
